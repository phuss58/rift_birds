# Introduction

Code presented here accompany Huss et al.'s study on birds of the Albertine Rift. This study focuses on whole genome analyses of birds across the region, specifically focusing on the following species:

1. *Batis diops* (Rwenzori Batis)
2. *Phylloscopus laetus* (Red-faced Woodland-Warbler)
3. *Dessonornis archeri* (Archer's Robin-Chat)
4. *Chamaetylas poliophrys* (Red-chested Alethe)

# Contents

This repository includes:

- Basename `.txt` files for basic analyses (`Basenames`) 
- Steps related to filtering files in preparations for analyses (`10_filter` and `11_filter_vcf`)
- Steps related to performing `admixture` analyses (`Admixture_Scripts`)
- *R* scripts and related scripts for performing genomic analyses such as Fst (`R scripts`)
- Additional scripts for installing programs and for remembering pathways (`extra_scripts`)
- Scripts for performing *EEMS* analyses (not included in publication; insufficient sample sizes and coverage; `EEMS_scripts`)
